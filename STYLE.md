This repo is formatted using prettier (see the .prettierrc file for more details).

Coding principles that I adhere to are:

1. each component/file should be small, easy to understand, and separated from other components.
2. no duplicated code.
3. the server should catch all exceptions and return an error
4. scss should be in BEM style (although the class naming scheme is blockName-elementName--modifierName)
