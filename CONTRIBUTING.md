# Contributing

If you want to add a feature or fix a bug, you can create an issue in GitHub (https://github.com/RitzyMage/comic-cms).

Even better, fix it yourself in a fork of this repo and create a pull request. Please see the style guide (STYLE.md) for coding guidelines.

I will review pull requests and may give you feedback that I want fixed before merging it.
